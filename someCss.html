		Starting a war, screaming, "Peace" at the same time
		All the corruption, injustice, the same crimes
		Always a problem if we do or don't fight
		And we die, we don't have the same right
		What is a gun to a man that surrenders?
		What's it gonna take for someone to defend her?
		If we all agree that we're equal as people
		Then why can't we see what is evil?
		I can't breathe
		You're taking my life from me
		I can't breathe
		Will anyone fight for me?
		How do we cope when we don't love each other?
		Where is the hope and the empathy? (Yeah)
		How do we judge off the color?
		The structure was made to make us the enemy (yeah)
		Prayin' for change 'cause the pain makes you tender
		All of the names you refuse to remember
		Was somebody's brother, friend
		Or a son to a mother that's crying, singing
		I can't breathe
		You're taking my life from me
		I can't breathe
		Will anyone fight for me? (Yeah)
		Will anyone fight for me?
		Trying times all the time
		Destruction of minds, bodies, and human rights
		Stripped of bloodlines, whipped and confined
		This is the American pride
		It's justifying a genocide
		Romanticizing the theft and bloodshed
		That made America the land of the free
		To take a black life, land of the free
		To bring a gun to a peaceful fight for civil rights
		You are desensitized to pulling triggers on innocent lives
		Because that's how we got here in the first place
		These wounds sink deeper than the bullet
		Your entitled hands could ever reach
		Generations and generations of pain, fear, and anxiety
		Equality is walking without intuition
		Saying the protector and the killer is wearing the same uniform
		The revolution is not televised
		Media perception is forced down the throats of closed minds
		So it's lies in the headlines
		And generations of supremacy resulting in your ignorant, privileged eyes
		We breathe the same and we bleed the same
		But still, we don't see the same
		Be thankful we are God-fearing
		Because we do not seek revenge
		We seek justice, we are past fear
		We are fed up eating your shit
		Because you think your so-called "Black friend"
		Validates your wokeness and erases your racism
		That kind of uncomfortable conversation
		Is too hard for your trust-fund pockets to swallow
		To swallow the strange fruit hanging from my family tree
		Because of your audacity
		To say all men are created equal in the eyes of God
		But disparage a man based on the color of his skin
		Do not say you do not see color
		When you see us, see us
		We can't breathe
